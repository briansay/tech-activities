# FizzBuzz TDD Challenge

## The challenge

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Remember, this is an open book exercise so feel free to use the internet and documentation where needed.

## What we are looking for

Feel free to share these points with the applicant if you feel the need to:

- Their ability to follow Test Driven Development (TDD) best practices e.g. writing tests first
- Their ability to talk about what they're doing and explaining their thought process
- Do they refactor throughout the exercise if required
- Are they cognicent of code best practices e.g. single responsibility, don't repear yourself (DRY), SOLID, etc.

## Tips for the IBM-er pair

1. Reaffirm throughout that this is an open book exercise. Encourage Googling & searching for documentation
2. This style of remote pairing isn't natural. You may need to initiate the conversations more often at the beginning of the exercise
3. Interviews are nerve-wracking. If the applicant seems frazzled then feel free to help them alog and make them more comfortable
