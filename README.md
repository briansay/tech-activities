# IBM Technology Garage Interviews - Cloud Engineers

This repository contains the pairing challenges we use for the UKI IBM Technology Garage interviews, tailored for our prospective Cloud Engineers.

This isn't a 'pass/fail' set of exercises. We are looking to see how you tackle a new challenge. How do you deal with a stack you aren't used to? How well can you look up documentation and help when you're stuck? There is no pass\fail. There is no 'right' answer.

We have 5 sets of challenges:

- [Programming challenge](https://github.com/briansay/tech-activities/tree/main/1-programming-challenge/fizz-buzz)
- [Contanerisation](https://github.com/briansay/tech-activities/tree/main/2-containerise)
- [Kubernetes / OpenShift Deployments](https://github.com/briansay/tech-activities/tree/main/3-k8s-deployment)
- [Alternative Deployments](https://github.com/briansay/tech-activities/tree/main/4-alternative-deployment)
- [Advanced Deployments](https://github.com/briansay/tech-activities/tree/main/5-advanced-deployment)

Take them one at a time and **don't cheat** and look ahead :wink:.
