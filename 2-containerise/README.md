# Containerise an application

## The challenge

Take the previous programming exercise that you just did and containerise it. This includes:

- Running the container locally
- Confirming the image runs and works as expected
- Pushing the container to an image registry

## What we are looking for

Feel free to share these points with the applicant if you feel the need to:

- Ability to write the Dockerfile
- Knowledge of Dockerfile layers
- Understanding of tagging and image repositories
- Ability to debug failed build attempts

## Tips for the IBM-er pair

1. Reaffirm throughout that this is an open book exercise. Encourage Googling & searching for documentation
2. This style of remote pairing isn't natural. You may need to initiate the conversations more often at the beginning of the exercise
3. Interviews are nerve-wracking. If the applicant seems frazzled then feel free to help them alog and make them more comfortable

## HelloWorld examples

If the applicant doesn't complete the FizzBuzz challenge then they can download these HelloWorld examples and containerise them.
