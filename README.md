# IBM Technology Garage Interviews - Cloud Engineers

# Quick Intro

This repository contains the pairing challenges we use for the UKI IBM Technology Garage interviews, tailored for our prospective Cloud Engineers.

This isn't a 'pass/fail' set of exercises. We are looking to see how applicants tackle a new challenge. How do they deal with a stack they aren't used to? How well can they look up documentation when stuck? There is no pass\fail. There is no 'right' answer.
